## Introduction

Hi, my name is Rikki but feel free to call me Rik for short.  I transferred from LCC, and this is my first semester here at Manoa.  I was born and raised in Pearl City, and this is my second attempt at college.  I am majoring in MIS and intend to double major in finance.  Prior to returning to school, I worked at an automotive shop for eleven and a half years and was a service manager.  As for hobbies, I am a big sports fan.  In particular my favorite team is the Colorado Avalanche.  I was lucky enough to go to their 2022 playoff games when they won the Stanley Cup, and I even ran into and met the team captain the day after the victory parade.  I look forward to working with everyone this semester and best of luck to everyone.
