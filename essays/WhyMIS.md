## Why major in MIS?

When I returned to college, I had no idea what I wanted to major in.  Having worked in a job where I was playing a role in running a business, some type of business-related major was a logical place to look.  My main concern was that I would be learning skills that would be marketable and versatile.  One thing that I understood was that technology was a key component in business, and that it can make or brake company.  Once I realized the versatility of a MIS degree I was sold.  The idea of learning tech skills but with business aspect was the type of thing I interested me, and was just the type of major I was looking for.
